# E-Commerce Platform

This is a modern e-commerce web application built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS. It provides a seamless shopping experience with product browsing, detailed product pages, a shopping cart, and a checkout process.

## Technologies Used

- React 19
- Vite (build tool and development server)
- Tailwind CSS (utility-first CSS framework)
- React Router DOM (client-side routing)
- React Responsive Carousel (for product image carousels)
- Lucide React (icon library)
- Context API (for cart state management)

## Features

- Home page with featured products
- Products listing page
- Product detail page with dynamic routing
- Shopping cart with context state management
- Checkout page
- Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ecomm-store
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Development Server

Start the development server with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the app at `http://localhost:5173` (default Vite port).
